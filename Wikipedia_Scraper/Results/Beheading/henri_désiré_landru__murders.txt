Landru began to run lonely hearts advertisements in Paris newspapers (for example, "Widower with two children, aged 43, with comfortable income, serious and moving in good society, desires to meet widow with a view to matrimony"). Because of World War I there were plenty of widows upon which he could prey. He would seduce women, gain access to their assets, then kill them and burn their dismembered bodies. Between 1914 and 1919 he killed ten women and the teenage son of one of them. The police did not connect the disappearance of these women, as Landru used a wide variety of aliases in his schemes. (He kept a ledger listing the particular alias he used when corresponding with each woman.)
In 1919, the sister of one of Landru's victims attempted to track down her down. She did not know Landru's real name but she knew his appearance and where he lived, and she eventually persuaded the police to arrest him. Initially, Landru was charged only with embezzlement. He refused to talk to the police, and with no bodies (police dug up his garden without result), there was seemingly insufficient evidence for a murder charge. However, police did eventually find fragmentary paperwork listing the missing women, and combining this with other documents provided the necessary evidence.
