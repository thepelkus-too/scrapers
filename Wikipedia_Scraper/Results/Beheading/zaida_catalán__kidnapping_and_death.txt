On 12 March 2017, Catalán and another UN employee, American Michael Sharp, were kidnapped during a mission near the village Ngombe in the Kasai Province in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.[10] They were both found dead on 27 March.[11] Catalán was found in a shallow grave [10], the body was beheaded presumably as some kind of ritual or statement from the executioners[12], and the head was not found despite the arresting of two primary suspects by Congolese authorities.[13]. The UN was reportedly horrified when a grisly video of the execution of the two UN experts surfaced in April, 2017.[14]
On 29 March, Swedish authorities launched an investigation into the murder of Zaida Catalán; the Minister for Education Gustav Fridolin and the Prime Minister Stefan Löfven both expressed their dismay and sadness over her death and offered their condolences to her family.[15] UN Secretary-General António Guterres also offered his condolences.[16]
Criticism of the U.N. has been expressed about the U.N.'s approach to the mission of their two experts.[17] They were sent into a remote and violence-torn area on motorbike taxis with only an interpreter at their side and without much training, safety equipment or even health insurance, an "astoundingly irresponsible approach by the United Nations to an obviously dangerous and hugely important task."[18]
