Reyes Moore, nicknamed Coté, completed her secondary education at Colegio Villa María in 1984. She worked between 1992 and 2007 as physical education teacher in Colegio San Francisco de Asís in Las Condes. She left that educational institution in 2007 because she "wanted to devote more time to her family."[22]
Shortly afterwards, she began working at Colegio El Golf in Vitacura, where she created a class called La Academia (The Academy). La Academia consisted of a pre-employment and functional workshop dedicated to high school graduates with special educational needs (necesidades educacionales especiales).[22]

He was known in his hometown as a "good", "hard-working" person.[25] At the time of his death, he was under medical license because of a recent surgery, which removed a hernia from his spine.[4]
