Most accounts say that on 10 July 2012 Juan Duarte visited Óscar López's antique shop "to purchase an iron stick".[1] Duarte's housemaid, Olga Morales, told El Mercurio that he was "actually interested in an old little table." Several people saw Duarte talking with López that afternoon.[2][3]
The police (carabineros) stated that López stabbed Duarte in the back and subsequently beheaded him.[1] They believed that Duarte tried to defend himself "tenaciously".[4] López kept Duarte's head in a coffer, which was up for sale in his antique shop, and buried the rest of his body under rocks in his backyard.[1][2] The following day, 11 July, Duarte's family filed a "presunta desgracia" (disappearance) claim with the Lolol police.[5]
On 12 July, María José Reyes Moore was traveling with two of her children, her 15-year-old daughter and 19-year-old son, to Fundo Querelena in the Bucarruca area in the commune of Paredones, Cardenal Caro Province.[6] Her husband and her two other children were traveling later that day.[7] At around 13:00 local time (17:00 UTC), she decided to stop in Lolol. She pulled up at Los Alerces Street 145 and went into López Rodríguez's antique shop with her daughter; her son stayed in the car.[6][7][8]
Less than five minutes later and apparently without reason,[9][10] López took Reyes Moore by her hair and stabbed her. Her daughter ran out of the shop to tell her brother. When they got back, they saw López taking their severely injured mother to a tree trunk in his backyard, where he proceeded to decapitate her with an axe.[8]
Reyes Moore's children ran out of the antique shop to ask for help and, according to witnesses, shouting "They're killing our mommy!" ("¡Están matando a la mamita!").[3] Because it was Lolol's payday, the streets of the town were full of people.[11] The teenagers eventually found a policeman, Sergeant Felipe González, who quickly got to the crime scene. In the meantime, López had taken Reyes' head and showed it to passers-by, raising the severed head "like a trophy". When González reached him, he ordered López to stop and fired into the air twice without receiving any response from López. López then rushed towards the policeman with the bloody ax he had used to decapitate Reyes Moore, forcing González to shoot him with his service weapon, killing him.[6][8][10]
