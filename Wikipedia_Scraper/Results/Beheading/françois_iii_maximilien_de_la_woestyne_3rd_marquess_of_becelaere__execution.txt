During this time, the Marquess took residence in Cambrai. The family resided in the Hotel de Becelaer since 1746, where he was arrested on the night of 22 Floréal. The marquess was sentenced in Arras as treasoner to the republic and condemned to death on behalf of Joseph Le Bon.[1] The marquess explained that he renounces his feodal titles, and renounces his old privileges. He explained that he did marry a simple commoner. His judges replied: " Ce n'est pas la truie qui démarquise, c'est le cochon qui ennoblit."
The judges have no mercy: both are to be executed by Guillotine.
The abbé Boniface testifies that this execution was horrible: because the knife had executed so many people they had to pull the axe up three times. The people witnessed the Marquess still alive and continuously crying until the end.[2]
However, historical records state that the couple were the only ones executed on that day.
