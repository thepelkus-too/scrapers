The murders were widely covered by the local media, and "shocked" the Chilean society.[27] The inhabitants of Lolol, a "peaceful" rural town which was declared a National Monument under the category of "Zona Típica" ("Typical Zone") for its colonial architecture,[3] were "anguished", and the town's streets were "empty" one week after the crimes. Some residents told the media they have been "ridiculed" in other towns, and asked for Óscar Lopez's house to be demolished.[28] The mayor of Lolol, Marco Marín, told La Tercera the crime "would mark a 'before' and an 'after' in the history of Lolol."[11]
The same day of the murder of María José Reyes and López's death, the Labocar (Laboratorio de Criminalística de Carabineros; literally Carabineros' Laboratory of Criminology) inspected the crime scene, under the request of public prosecutor Carmen Gloria Agurto, finding the decapitated body of another victim, later identified as Juan Duarte Becerra. Labocar also checked some wells in the backyard of López's house.[10] The following day, looking for more possible victims and evidence, the Labocar and GOPE (Grupo de Operaciones Policiales Especiales; in English, the Group of Special Police Operations) continued to inspect the crime scene, and visited López's former residence in Las Palmas, but they did not find human remains.[3]
Following the murders, there was suspicion that López Rodríguez might also have killed Manuel Fuenzalida Piña, a man from the commune of Pumanque, also in Colchagua Province, who had disappeared in March 2012 and was last seen talking with López.[29] Police searched López's shop and former residences for additional human remains, but did not find any.[30]
O'Higgins Region public prosecutor Luis Toledo announced the Ministerio Público would give psychological assistance to Reyes' children, as they witnessed the crime. The public prosecutor office of Santa Cruz requested the OS-9 (Departamento Investigación de Organizaciones Criminales; Department of Investigation of Criminal Organizations) to prepare a "psychological autopsy", as not much was known as to why López committed the crime, creating a profile based on interviews with people who interacted with him, and information extracted from the crime scene.[3][31] The results of the "psychological autopsy" were made public on 25 July 2012, and pointed out that López Rodríguez "suffered of transitory psychosis, mystical delusions and bizarre behaviours."[32]
Sergeant Felipe González, aged 26, was given "psychological help" by the Carabineros, and was "calm with the help of the Carabineros authorities."[3] However, his actions are to be investigated whether they adhered to the rules of Carabineros or not.[33]
On 13 July 2012, at around 09:00 local time (13:00 UTC), relatives of María José Reyes arrived at the Servicio Médico Legal (Legal Medical Service) of San Fernando, where an autopsy was done, and took her body to Vitacura, Santiago Metropolitan Region,[3] where a wake over her body was held at Parroquia San Juan de Apóstol.[7] A mass commanded by priest Osvaldo Fernández was held on 14 July 2012 at the Parroquia San Juan de Apóstol, attended by about one thousand people.[34] María José Reyes' body was taken to the Parque del Recuerdo cemetery, where she was cremated and later buried.[35]
The body of Juan Duarte Becerra was mourned at his mother's home in Lolol on 13 July 2012. During the early morning of the following day, and after an evangelical prayer, his body was buried in the Municipal Cemetery of Lolol. The funeral was attended by hundreds of Lolol residents.[24][25]
Óscar López Rodriguez's body was taken by his son during the night of 13 July 2012 from the Servicio Médico Legal of San Fernando. His body was waked at his parents' home in Los Boldos, near Santa Cruz, and was buried the following day in the Cemetery of Santa Cruz, in a ceremony attended by about a hundred persons. His former wife did not attend his funeral.[14][25]
