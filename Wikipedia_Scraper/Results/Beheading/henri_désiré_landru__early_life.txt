Landru was born in Paris. After leaving school, he spent four years in the French Army from 1887 to 1891,and afterward had a sexual relationship with his cousin, who bore him a daughter. He married another woman two years later and had four children. After being swindled by his employer, he turned to fraud himself, often swindling elderly widows; he was sentenced to two years' imprisonment in 1900, the first of several such convictions. By 1914, Landru was estranged from his wife and working as a second-hand furniture dealer.
