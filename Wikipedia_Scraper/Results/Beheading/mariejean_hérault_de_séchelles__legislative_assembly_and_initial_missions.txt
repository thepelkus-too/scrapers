He was elected as a deputy for Paris to the Legislative Assembly in September 1782,[5] where he gravitated towards the extreme left. He also served as a member of several committees; during his time as a member of the diplomatic committee, in June 1793, he presented a memorable report demanding that the nation should be declared to be in danger.
During and after the 10 August 1792 insurrection, he worked alongside Georges Danton, one of the organizers and leading figures of this rising and, on 2 September, was appointed president of the Legislative Assembly.
In 1792, he was elected to the National Convention as deputy for the département of Seine-et-Oise, and was sent on a mission to organize the new département of Mont Blanc. He was thus absent during the trial of King Louis XVI, but he made it known that he approved of his execution.
