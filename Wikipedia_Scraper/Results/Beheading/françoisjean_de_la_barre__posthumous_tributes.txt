The Freemasons of the Grand Orient of France and other organized freethinkers obtained the elevation of the first Chevalier de la Barre statue in Paris as "the antidote in front of poison" to the Basilica of the Sacred Heart of Jesus of Paris (Sacré-Cœur) on Montmartre during 1897.[6] The Municipal Council of Paris during 1904 recovered 5000 m² of land wrongfully retained by the Archdiocese and decided to award a 5,000 franc grant toward the completion of the statue at this location in line with the great portal of the Sacré-Cœur, Paris.[6][7]
A full-size mock-up of the statue and base, as sculpted by freethinker Armand Bloch, was inaugurated on 3 September 1905 at the Congress of Freethinkers.[6][8] The following year, 1906, the statue was cast in bronze and was placed 'provisionally' by the Paris City Council at the gate of the Sacré-Cœur basilica during a ceremony which was attended by approximately 25,000 spectators.[6]
In 1926 the statue of the Chevalier de la Barre on Montmartre was moved away from the approach of the basilica entrance to the nearby and lower elevation of Square Nadar. This original Chevalier de la Barre statue by Bloch was eventually toppled on 11 October 1941 and melted down with other non-religious statues by the Vichy France regime under Marshal and Chief of State of Vichy France Philippe Pétain.[9][10]
The Paris City Council decided on 24 February 2001 to erect a new statue of the Chevalier de la Barre at the Square Nadar. It is the work of sculptor Emmanuel Ball.
Rue du Chevalier de La Barre is a Paris street that is located behind the Sacré-Cœur, between the Rue Ramey and the Rue du Mont-Cenis and also is the postal street address of the Sacré-Cœur basilica.
The Freemasons of the Grand Orient of France placed a bouquet of flowers during a 1902 memorial at the Abbeville location of la Barre execution site, forming the creation of the group la Barre that was organized as a ceremonial event running through the city center of Abbeville.
A la Barre monument was first erected on the banks of the Canal de la Somme at the la Barre execution site in Abbeville in 1907 with funds collected by voluntary subscription and the obelisk with its bronze plaque depicting the la Barre torture and execution remains standing today.[9]
The bronze plaque depicting the torture of the Chevalier Lefebvre de la Barre was temporarily removed from the la Barre monument during the World War II military occupation of France and hidden in a creek for safekeeping from the Vichy France regime. Under this plate reads "In Commemoration of the Martyrdom of the Chevalier de La Barre tortured in Abbeville on 1 July 1766 at the age of 19 years for failing to salute a procession." At the base is inscribed the date of the inauguration: "7 July 1907."
Today, the la Barre name and both the Abbeville monument and Parisian statue of la Barre have become iconic representations of the victims of religious intolerance in France and are regarded as rallying points for freethinkers. Three associations exist with the name of the Chevalier de la Barre in Paris, Abbeville, and the Masonic Lodge of the Grand Orient of France in Bergerac.
The Abbeville monument to the Chevalier de la Barre was vandalized on 22 June 2013 by supporters of the Civitas movement (fr).[11]
