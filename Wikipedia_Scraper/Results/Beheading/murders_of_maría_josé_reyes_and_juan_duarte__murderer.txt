Óscar Segundo López Rodríguez, labeled by the Chilean media as the "Monstruo de Lolol" ("Monster of Lolol"),[8] was born on 1 November 1972 in Lolol, Colchagua Province, O'Higgins Region. His parents were Óscar del Carmen López Araya and Osvaldina de las Rosas Rodríguez Espinosa.[15] Considered a "violent" and "lonely man" by his neighbors, López claimed to be a "messenger of God".[4][16] López liked to dress as anime characters.[17]
He was known in Lolol as "the Hippie", because of his "intentionally unkempt look, with beard and long hair," possibly inspired in the looks of Jesus Christ. Some Lolol residents have told the media that López may have been part of a satanic sect. He was also a user of marijuana,[17] which he reportedly also sold.[4]
López began collecting phonographs, lamps, cart wheels and iron gates in 1997, when he moved to Los Boldos, a rural area near Santa Cruz.[4] Sometime afterwards, he moved to Los Robles, six kilometers from the urban centre of Lolol, where he joined an "ecologic community", of which he was later expelled. In August 2009, he moved to Las Palmas, three kilometers from central Lolol, and lived in three different houses there until March 2010.[18] After the earthquake of 27 February 2010, he moved to his last home, an old adobe house, located in front of the Lolol firefighters' bureau. There, he established an antique shop, in the front of the house.[4]
In an article published in regional newspaper El Mundo Rural in April 2012, López Rodríguez was described as a "modest man, who has worked hard with the shovel and the plow in the countryside," but "[his life] is devoted to visiting houses and rescuing antiquities which he repairs and sells to wealthy families." El Mundo Rural newspaper also remarked his ability to ride his bike with his dog Valentín standing on it.[12]
López Rodríguez married Sandra Andrea Poblete Gaete (b. 16 August 1973) in Santa Cruz, on 31 August 1992. The couple had a son (born 1992), and divorced on 6 April 2011.[4][14][19]
