Very little is known about Müntzer’s wife, other than the fact that she was a nun who had left a nunnery under the influence of the Reformation movement. Her family name may have been ‘von Görschen’. She may have been one of a group of sixteen nuns who left the convent at Wiederstedt, some miles north of Allstedt, of whom eleven found refuge in Allstedt. She and Müntzer were married in June 1523. Apart from the son born to her and Müntzer on Easter Day, 1524, it is possible she was again pregnant at the time of her husband's death - by which time also, the son may have died. A letter she wrote to Duke Georg on 19 August 1525, pleading for the chance to recover her belongings from Mühlhausen, went unheeded,[48] No further reports of her life have been found.
