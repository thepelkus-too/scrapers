On June 30, 2013, Otávio was refereeing an amateur football match at Pio XII, in Maranhão, Brazil.[4][5] Otávio sent off player Josemir Santos Abreu, 31, who refused to leave the field and began a fight with the referee. Abreu threw a punch, which prompted Otávio to draw a knife from his pocket and repeatedly stab Abreu. Abreu died on the way to the hospital.[2][6] When fans watching the game, including Abreu's friends and family, found out about his death,[7] they invaded the pitch[8] and stoned Cantanhede, before decapitating him, quartering him,[9] and putting his head on a stake in the pitch.[2][10][11][12][13] Police chief Valter Costa was quoted as saying "One crime will never justify another".[2][14]
